This demo is the reconstruction code for SMS-EPI motion correction. 
Phase compensation (correction) for data has been implemented in real time. The demo focuses on the coil sensitivity maps (CSMs) correction for SMS-EPI recon with motion. 
SMS-SENSE and Split Slice-GRAPPA reconstruction are included in the demo. CSMs generation, CSMs phase alignment (kernelEig.m) and interpolation are also included in the demo. 

How to use

Run demo.m script in MATLAB.
